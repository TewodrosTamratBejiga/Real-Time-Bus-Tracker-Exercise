# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker-Exercise
This project is part of working with DOM in JavaScript and requires adding animation to maps. To achieve this goal, mapbox an open-source platform that allows us to create and display maps on a web page, was used. The mapboxgl JavaScript library is part of the Mapbox ecosystem and it allows us to add all sorts of customizations to the map. In this project I will be using the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. Then, added an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes. This Exercise is under progress and will be updated as it progress.
